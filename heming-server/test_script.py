In order to recall what got done yesterday & needs to get done today, ICs need to revisit information on platforms like JIRA, Github, and Google Docs, shuttle it over, and then synthesize it into an update within Slack. This is stressful and time-consuming, which results in low quality updates that are often not published at all. Managers, as a result, struggle to get a reliable pulse on what their team is working on and how theyâ€™re tracking against their goals."
